# Ahrefs Keyword Sentiment Analysis Tool

This Python-based tool automates sentiment analysis on keyword exports from Ahrefs, providing valuable insights for SEO and marketing strategies. It leverages the Google Natural Language API to evaluate the emotional tone behind keywords, offering an innovative angle to traditional SEO practices.

## Description

The Ahrefs Keyword Sentiment Analysis Tool is designed to enrich your SEO keyword data by adding a layer of sentiment analysis. By processing a CSV file exported from Ahrefs, the tool appends two insightful metrics to each keyword: 'Sentiment Score' and 'Sentiment Magnitude'. Additionally, it categorizes each keyword with an 'Emotional Leaning' label (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and a 'Strength of Emotion' label (Low, Moderate, High), which can be instrumental in understanding user intent and emotional responses.

## Benefits for SEO

- **User Intent Understanding**: By analyzing the sentiment of keywords, you can gain insights into the searcher's emotional state, helping to tailor content that aligns with user intent.
- **Content Strategy Development**: Positive and strong sentiments can inform content strategies to target enthusiastic audiences, potentially increasing engagement and conversions.
- **Brand Monitoring**: Track how brand-related keywords are perceived, allowing for proactive reputation management.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Assess the emotional appeal of keywords your competitors rank for and adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Market Trends**: Spot shifts in sentiment over time, which may indicate changing consumer attitudes or market trends.

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large numbers of keywords by batching API requests to comply with rate limits.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and incremental CSV updating to ensure no data loss in case of interruptions.
